# What this program does:
This is a program that takes two inputs from the user to get their name and age.
It then returns both inputs as part of a greeting to the user. 

# How to use it:
Installation:
Run the command 'git clone git@github.com:eansmith/cmpinf0010skillslab5.git' to add it to your jupyter notebook.

Here's what it looks like and what it does:

'''name = input("Enter Name")
age = input("Enter age")    
print("Hello " + name + ". You are " + age + " years old.")
'''
If one typed "Jackson" and "23" as their input, the output would be:
Hello Jackson. You are 23 years old.
